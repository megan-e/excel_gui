# excel_gui
GUI programmed for easy calculations and generation of simple graphs.

Purpose: To determine the total colony forming units per gram (CFU/g) of product. 

How it Works: Bacterical colonies are counted and input into excel template, along with initial mass/volume measurements. The GUI works to calculate the CFU/g from excel, overwrites the excel sheet with calculated values, and generates simple graphs. Used to save time from manually inputting values into excel sheets with equations, which allowed for more errors to occur. 

Packages used: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib
Language used: Python
