# excel_gui
GUI programmed for easy calculations and generation of simple graphs.

Purpose: To determine the total colony forming units per gram (CFU/g) of product. 

How it Works: Bacterical colonies are counted and input into excel template, along with initial mass/volume measurements. The GUI accesses the excel sheet, calculates the CFU/g, overwrites the excel sheet with new calculated values, and generates simple graphs. Used to save time from manually inputting values into excel sheets with equations, which allowed for more errors to occur. 

Packages used: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib
Language used: Python

Each column represents which method was used (each have different equations).
